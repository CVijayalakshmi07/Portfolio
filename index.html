      Hello, I'm C. Vijaya Lakshmi — An MCA student with a strong interest in
      Web Development. I enjoy learning through practice, exploring new
      technologies, and building small projects that help me grow step by step.
      This portfolio showcases my Education, Projects, Internships, and
      Certificates.

      <h1>PERSONAL INTRODUCTION</h1>

      <p>
        My journey into technology began with curiosity, but it soon turned into
        something I genuinely enjoy. I like creating clean, simple websites using
        HTML & CSS and understanding how things work behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I’ve become more confident, more expressive, and more willing
        to take on challenges that help me learn.
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        I believe growth is a continuous process — every small project, every
        task, every error teaches me something new. Learning never stops, and
        neither will I.
