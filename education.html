        <h3>MCA – Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering</h3>
        <h4>2024 – 2026 | 2nd Year</h4>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
          at Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, Tirupati.
          My studies focus on web development, programming,
          Python, HTML, CSS, and software application development.
          Through projects and assignments, I am improving my
          problem-solving and technical skills.

        <h3>BCA – SDHR Degree & PG College</h3>
        <h4>Affiliated to Sri Venkateswara University</h4>
        <p>
          During those quiet pandemic years, I started exploring the 
          world of technology more seriously and realized my interest 
          in building a career in this field. That journey led me to 
          choose BCA as my path, where I studied at SDHR Degree and 
          PG College under Sri Venkateswara University. My time there 
          not only strengthened my technical basics but also helped me 
          grow personally — transforming me into a more confident 
          communicator and a more balanced, expressive person.
